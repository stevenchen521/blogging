    "# Definition\n",
    "Based on [wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Symmetric_matrix), in linear algebra, a symmetric matrix is a square matrix that is equal to its transpose. Formally, $A=A^T$ where $A$ is the matrix. The entries of the symmetric matrix $A$ are symmetric with respect to the main diagonal. More specificallt, suppose $a_{ij}$ denotes the emelent of $A$, then we have $a_{ij}=a_{ji}$.\n",
