    "Based on [wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Definite_matrix), in mathematics, a symmetric matrix $M$ with real entries is positive-definite if the real number $z^TMz$ is positive for every nonzero real column vector $z$, where $z^T$ is the transpose of $z$\n"

After the transformation the direction of $\\hat z$ is changed(excpet if $z$ is the eigenvector of $M$) compared to $z$. The angel between them is within 90 degrees we call the matrix $M$ is the positive definite matrix.\n",
