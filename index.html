Hey, there. Welcome to my blog. 


The tech world is changing so fast. Do you still remmeber what it looked like ten years ago? When I was at middle school since I thought once we got a job we don't need to study anymore. Obviously I was wrong. It was Greek philosopher Heraclitus who said that "change is the only constant in life." I would say the best way to protect ourselves in the world is to keep improving ourselves, isn't it?


Here is bascially a place to record my learning journey. However, it may help you as well.


My current interested topics: Machine Learning, Deep Learning, DevOps and some math fundation.
